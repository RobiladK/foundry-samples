# Set up Azure AI Foundry with Customer Managed Keys for Encryption

This Azure AI Foundry template example demonstrates how to configure customer-managed key encryption on an AI Foundry resource.

Configuring customer managed keys is performed using a two-step approach, in which first the resource is created without encryption to allow the managed identity to be created. In a second step, the managed identity is assigned access to your key vault and encryption is applied on your resource.

Run the command for BICEP:

az deployment group create --name "{DEPLOYMENT_NAME}" --resource-group "{RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}" --template-file ./main.bicep --parameters azureKeyVaultName="{KEY_VAULT_NAME}" azureKeyName="{KEY_NAME}" azureKeyVersion="{KEY_VERSION}"

Prerequisites:
1. An Azure Key Vault with an existing key, soft delete and purge protection enabled

Limitations:
1. Agent service does not support customer-managed key encryption in the basic setup. To use customer-managed key encryption, you must bring your own storage resources using the standard setup.
