# üí¨ Customer Support Agent

This is a code sample for a multi-phase workflow built with Azure AI Agent Service, designed to assist customers with secure authentication and billing inquiries. It uses a state-based orchestration to verify customer identity and retrieve billing information, while supporting human-in-the-loop escalation.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Starter templates, instructions, code samples and resources in this msft-agent-samples file (‚Äúsamples‚Äù) are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents for specific scenarios. It is important that you review all provided resources and carefully test Agent behavior in the context of your use case: ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/agents/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext)). 

Certain Agent offerings may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may require licenses, or may not be suitable for all industries, scenarios, or use cases.‚ÄØBy using any sample, you are acknowledging that Agents or other output created using that sample are solely your responsibility, and that you will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and relevant safety standards, terms of service, and codes of conduct.

## üíº Use Cases

- **Customer Authentication**: Verify users through ID or account number prior to handling sensitive queries.
- **Billing Inquiry Support**: Retrieve and explain billing details for a verified account.
- **Agent Escalation Readiness**: Stream output to users and fallback to human-in-loop if input or context is missing.
- **Workflow Handoff**: Easily expandable to handle follow-ups like payment assistance, usage summaries, or complaint handling.

## üß© Tools & Capabilities

This agent is orchestrated using **Azure AI Agent Service** with the following states and components:

### üîê `Authentication` State

- **Agent**: `CustomerAuthenticator`  
- **Purpose**: Validates the customer and extracts a `CustomerId`
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Enabled on missing input or failed authentication
- **Output**:  
  - `CustomerAccount ‚Üí CustomerId`

### üí≥ `Billing` State

- **Agent**: `CustomerServiceAgent`  
- **Purpose**: Retrieves customer billing details using `CustomerId` as input
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Enabled if no message or context is missing
- **Input**:  
  - `accountNumber ‚Üê CustomerId`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Azure subscription with the following permissions
   - Contributor or Cognitive Services Contributor role (for resource deployment)
   - Azure AI Developer and Cognitive Services user role (for agent creation)
2. Agent setup: deploy the latest agent setup using this ([custom deployment](https://www.aka.ms/basic-agent-deployment)).
   - The above creates:
      - AI Services resource
      - AI Project
      - Model deployment
3. Azure CLI
4. Install VS Code
5. Download and install VSCode Extension (Early acccess) from this link https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/samples/agent-catalog/vscode_ext_early_access


### VSCode extension (early access) setup

WARNING: This extension is an experimental version and is not recommended for us in production environments. The official version of the Azure AI Foundry VS Code Extension will be supporting multi-agent workflows in the near future.


### Easy Setup (optional)

```
set -eu
export CONNECTION_STRING= "<host>;<subscription_id>;<resource_group>;<project_name>"
